# STOCK PRICE PREDICTION ON APPLE, AMAZON, GOOGLE, MICROSOFT STOCKS

This project performs stock price prediction using Keras deep learning model. The dataset is analyzed using exploratory data analysis, comparing features such as moving average, return of the stock, risk ratio, etc. for each stock.

The model is trained using MSE as the loss function and ADAM as the optimizer, with a custom learning rate. The results show the RMSE values for each stock: Apple Stocks – RMSE: 4.87 (epoch = 200), Tesla Stocks – RMSE: 87.15(epoch = 200), Google Stocks – RMSE: 63.94(epoch = 300), Microsoft – RMSE: 7.06(epoch = 400), Amazon – RMSE : 92.44(epoch = 500).

To run the project, simply download or clone the repository and open the notebook file in Google Colab. Make sure to have the necessary dependencies installed.
